## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

The 1337bank.money server is vulnerable to arbitrary command injection, so it'll execute any command I give it after the first parameter.  For instance, I can list the contents of the root directory by typing in ```8.8.8.8; ls```.  In order to launch a shell, I did ```8.8.8.8; /bin/bash```, then cd into the home directory, and then cat the ```flag.txt``` file.  The shell did not have a prompt or show error messages, but it worked well enough to let me navigate around.

Flag: ```CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}```

In order to protect against this vulnerability, Fred could sanitize input to make sure the user is inputting in a valid ip address or domain.  He could also whitelist special characters such as ```;``` or ```&``` so the command injection could not be used.

There are uptime scripts located in ```/usr/bin/uptime``` and ```/proc/uptime```.
