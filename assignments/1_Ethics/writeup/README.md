This is definitely an extremely serious issue, as the flaws in the current ECU firmware could result in damage to both the car and its occupants.  A lot of the time, when a company discovers a cybersecurity breach, they simply ignore it, as it takes an immense ammount of time to fix and does not increase their revenue in any way.  However, the ECU security problems pose a direct threat to the safety of its occcupants, so everyone should be made aware of this issue.  
You should be careful when releasing the findings of your audit, as to not cause public disarray or unecessary panic.  First tell your boss: he will know the best way to handle the situation by notifying his higher ups and the company's PR department.  They will strategically begin working on a fix and notify the public in a safe and informing manner.  If your boss decides to ignore your findings and cover up the security problems, it is now your job to inform the consumer watchdog about what is going on.  I don't think that a junior developer should ever tell the public about findings like this, since releasing security information about a company's internal firmware is extremely dangerous for both the company and the general public.  If your company is still unwilling to to postpone the ECU's release, you need to continually harass your boss until he realizes the gravity of this situation.  The boss is obviously under pressure from his superiors in order to meet deadlines, but it is not worth to sacrifice safety for an earlier release date.  This is your best approach, as going directly to the public can have disastrous consequences.  

Some people may think that no matter what, the general public has to know about the ECU's security flaws, and they do raise a few good points.  Why keep information directly related to consumer safety away from the general public?  Shouldn't they have a right to know about any issues that may endager to occupants.  While these are all valid arguments, there is a reason companies do not release every single security hole they find to the general public.  The first is to minimize public panic, and the second is that by doing so, they may inadverdently reveal some information to malicious people.  Furthermore, if this security hole is large enough it may be picked up through testing by other parts of the company or by the federal government.

As a junior developer, you obviously do not have a lot of influence on the company, but be sure to document the findings from your audit in case any harm does result from the security problems.
